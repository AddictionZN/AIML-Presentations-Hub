From APIs to MCP: Unlocking Seamless AI Integration in Finance
Key Themes:
- Introducing MCP: Briefly explain the Model Context Protocol as a “USB-C for AI” that standardizes interactions between AI models and legacy financial systems.
- Enabling Interoperability: Discuss how MCP can allow financial institutions and fintech platforms to more easily exchange data, improve onboarding, real-time fraud monitoring, and personalized customer support.
- Implications for Fintech Innovation: Highlight examples such as how companies like Block, Sardine, or even speculative “Plaid MCP” integrations could revolutionize digital banking and payments by reducing friction in connecting disparate systems.

Speech Tip: Consider weaving an analogy that makes MCP relatable (e.g., a universal adapter) so that even nontechnical stakeholders can appreciate its impact.
